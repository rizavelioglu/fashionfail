## Install
[todo]
```bash
pip install fashionfail       # basic usage
pip install fashionfail[dev]  # full development
```


## Usage

> We provide an explanation of each step in great detail, [please check them out here.](references/00_table_of_content.md)

### FashionFail Dataset
Check out [this file](references/01_dataset_creation) to get detailed information on how the dataset was generated, _i.e._
scraping, filtering, annotating and quality review.

The dataset _(annotations and image URLs)_ is available at [![Generic badge][logo-hf_datasets]][ff-hf_datasets].
Execute the following to download the dataset (which downloads the annotation files and images for each `train`, `val`,
and `test` splits):
```bash
python fashionfail/data/make_dataset.py \
--save_dir "dir/to/save" \  # [optional] default: "~/.cache/fashionfail/"
```


### FashionFail Models
Trained models are available at [![Generic badge][logo-hf_models]][ff-hf_models], where you can download the models.
To run inference using models, execute:

```bash
python fashionfail/models/predict_models.py \
--model_path "<PATH_TO_ONNX>" \
--out_dir "<OUTPUT_DIR>" \        # predictions are stored here
--image_dir "<IMAGES_DIR>"        # image dir to run inference for
```


Alternatively, you can check out the demo in a browser at [![Generic badge][logo-hf_spaces]][ff-hf_spaces].
One could also use the API of the demo to run inference:
```bash
python fashiofail/models/predict_hf_space.py \
--path_to_img "<PATH_TO_IMAGE>.jpg"
```



### Training

> Please see **_detailed explanation_** of training both `Facere` and `Facere+` models [here.](references/03_training.md)

> And see the inference for `Attribute Mask R-CNN` and `Fashionformer` [here.](references/05_evaluation.md)
